Task - 2 : Create a Gussing Game

I developed this as a Application utilizing Java and Swing which is a Java's platfrom independent GUI toolkit and has more fuctionalities as compared to AWT. Swing Applications will runs faster coz,it is entirely written in java and it's components are lightweight so they consume fewere system resources than AWT applications. Leveraging Java and SWing, I've crafted this GUI which generates a random number and challenges th user to guess it. The program should prompt the user to input their guess, Compared it to the generated number, adn provide feedback if the guess is Too high or Too low. It should continue until the user correctly guesses the number and then display the number of attempts it took to win the game.
